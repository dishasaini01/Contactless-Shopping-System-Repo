# Efficient Crowd Management System

- Developed a web application that provides real-time analytics on wait times and crowd density in supermarkets, enhancing customer experience by offering live insights on queue lengths.
- Utilized QLess to scale the application, providing personalized insights tailored to individuals based on their social and economic backgrounds.
- The system updates users on the number of people in the market and the current queue status during specific time intervals, enabling better crowd management and reducing wait times.

# People Counter Model

- The People Counter program allows you to count the number of people in a video passing through a Region of Interest, which is created by the user.
- Created a crowd monitoring system to count the number of people passing through a defined Region of Interest (ROI), designed to track foot traffic in environments like supermarkets.
- Developed the model using Python 3 and OpenCV 3.4, employing HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and Linear SVM classifiers for accurate object detection, along with Non-Maximum 
  Suppression (NMS) to minimize false positives.
- The system differentiates between people moving toward and moving away from the camera, categorizing movement as "In" or "Out." The detected people are then captured with SIFT (Scale- 
  Invariant Feature Transform) for further analysis and visualization.
